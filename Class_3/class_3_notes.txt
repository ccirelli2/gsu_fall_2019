Identifying Forged Images from GANs----------------------------------------

Topic:		How do you identify forged images. 
GAN		General adversarial network. 
		This person does not exist.com
Two sides	Generator - 		lier or counterfiter
		Discriminator - 	lie detector or a detector to find it the counterfit is
					real.

LCRN		Learning automata and Clustering based Routing Algorithm.

Yusen's Presentation -------------------------------------------------------

RELU		Most useful activation function.  Sigmoid does not do well for 
		many reasons. 
		f(u) = max(0,u)
		Prevents the gradient vanishing problem. 
		gradient exploding = you set a threshold and if the gradient is above
		you clip it. 

		** How does RELU create a non-linear function?


Softmax		used in the output later for functions with multiple targets as opposed
		to binary
